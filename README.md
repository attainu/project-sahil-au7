# EDUCATE INDIA

What we are trying to build?

We are trying to build a platform where students can get more good quality content free of cost, which seems to have taken a back step in the era of educational Industry dominance

Introduction:

Educate India - A purpose to change the way education is perceived and delivered. In which we aim to provide free learning opportunity to the students of all streams and particularly to the aspirants who are preparing for the competitive exams. Most of the times, we tend to Join some overpriced coaching institutes in search of proper guidance and Educational content sites like Unacedemy and BYJUâ€™s. Despite the same quality content is available on other free platforms like YouTube for free. But the content on YouTube is not really in organized manner so we are here trying to organize the content for the students who are eager to learn but canâ€™t afford the overpriced organizations.
